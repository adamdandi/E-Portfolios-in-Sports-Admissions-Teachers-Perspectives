### **Overview Headline:**  
High School Physical Education Teachers' Perceptions on E-Portfolio Assessment for College Admission Tests in Sports Majors: A Quantitative Study 

### **Overview:**  
This study investigates how high school physical education teachers perceive the use of e-portfolios in college admission tests for sports majors. E-portfolios are becoming more popular as a way to assess students' non-academic achievements, especially in sports. The study uses a quantitative approach, including the Delphi method to validate the questionnaire, to understand teacher perceptions fully.

### **Data Details:**  
The data was collected from a purposive sample of 17 high school physical education teachers in the Solo-Raya Region of Central Java, Indonesia. These teachers have experience assessing e-portfolios of students who took the admissions test for sports state universities. The data was collected using a closed questionnaire designed as a Guttman scale with two response options: "true" or "false".

### **Problem Statement:**  
This study aims to address the following questions:
- What are the perceptions of high school physical education teachers regarding the use of e-portfolios in college admission tests for sports majors?
- Are there any misunderstandings or variations in the perceptions of physical education teachers regarding e-portfolio assessment?

### **Solution:**  
A quantitative descriptive research design was utilized. The Delphi method was employed for questionnaire validation, and a Guttman scale was used in the questionnaire to gather clear and specific answers about the problem.

### **Insight:**  
- A significant majority of physical education teachers hold positive perceptions of e-portfolio assessment, with 59% categorizing their perceptions as "high" and 41% as "moderate".    
- These teachers view e-portfolios as a tool that enhances clarity and openness in the evaluation process.    
- Despite generally favorable perceptions, variations and misunderstandings among teachers exist, highlighting the need for consistent understanding and communication.  

### **Recommendation:**  
1. **Enhance Teacher Training:** Develop comprehensive programs for physical education teachers to standardize understanding and improve guidance quality.  
2. **Consistent Standards:** Introduce clear, standardized procedures for creating and assessing e-portfolios.  
3. **Further Research:** Investigate the direct impact of teacher guidance on student outcomes to refine the assessment process further.
